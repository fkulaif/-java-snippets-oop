## Object-Oriented Programming
### Object-oriented programming or simply OOP is a programming paradigm that is widely used in software development. It is based on the concept of classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. OOP is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints, which are used to create individual instances of objects

### The four core concepts of OOP are:

### Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world. It is achieved by using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected to restrict access to the objectâ€™s properties and methods

### Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity of an object and showing only the essential features to the outside world. It is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces

### Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the existing class and can also add new properties and methods

### Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It is achieved by using method overloading and method overriding

### These concepts help developers to write code that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. OOP is used in many programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript
